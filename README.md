******Badminton
 Badminton is a game that we can play **indoors and outdoors**. Traditionally people play it indoors. It is a game of speed and accuracy, and I love the sport.

I love playing badmintones practice and precision. My arms feel heavy after a long session, but I love how strong I feel afterwards.
with my friends. I love the feeling of **getting better and better at the game**.
